# BandiCore documentation
Welcome to the BandiCore documentation. The documentation is split up into two parts:

1. [Configuration and usage](configuration/index.md) contains information on how to configure config files and other settings. This is what you need to know to use the BandiCore when it has been set up on a server.
2. [Development](developers/index.md) contains information on how to develop the BandiCore. This is what you need to know if you want to contribute to the BandiCore.

Choose either of these options to continue.

## Missing something?
You can always contact `PartyProNL` on Discord if you have further questions, or if something is not covered by the documentation. If you are reading this and your name is `Youri`, I'm sorry for you.
