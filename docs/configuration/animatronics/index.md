# Animatronics
Animatronics are a way to make models animate on the server. They are complicated but allow for many cool effects.

## Setup
Animatronics are created via `BlockBench` with `Animated Java`. BlockBench is a 3D modelling program used to create Minecraft models. Animated Java allows you to animate rigs and export them.

First, install BlockBench. You can download it from [here](https://blockbench.net/). Once you have installed BlockBench, you must install the Animated Java plugin. You can do this by going to `File` -> `Plugins` -> `Available` -> `Animated Java` -> `Install`.
